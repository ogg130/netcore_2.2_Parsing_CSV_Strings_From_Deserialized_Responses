This is a simple research project that I used to help some co-workers work thorough a task that we had that was turning out to be quite laborious. 

    MAIN CODE- Controllers/ValuesController 
    EXTENSION METHODS - Utils/Extensions.cs.

Most of the credit for this goes to the fantastic extention method which was found as the main answer on this stack overflow thread. Much thanks to the author!:
