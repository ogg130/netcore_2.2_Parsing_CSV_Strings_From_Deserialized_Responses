This is a simple research project that I used to help some co-workers work thorough a task that we had that was turning out to be quite laborious. 

The main code is under Controllers/ValuesController and the extension method that does all of the magic us under Utils/Extensions.cs.

Most of the credit for this goes to the fantastic extention method which was found as the main answer on this stack overflow thread. Much thanks to the author!:
